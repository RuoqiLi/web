"Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all
disarranged..."<br><br><br><br>
"Oh! How beautiful you are!" <br><br><br><br>
"Am I not?" the flower responded, sweetly. "And I was born at the same moment
as the sun..." <br><br><br><br>

"I think it is time for breakfast," she added an instant later. "If you would have the
kindness to think of my needs−−"<br><br><br><br>
And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling−can of
fresh water. So, he tended the flower. <br><br><br><br></p></div>

	One day, for instance, when she
was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:<br><br><br><br>
"Let the tigers come with their claws!"<br><br><br><br>
"There are no tigers on my planet," the little prince objected. "And, anyway, tigers
do not eat weeds."<br><br><br><br>
"I am not a weed," the flower replied, sweetly.<br><br><br><br>


</p></div>
<div class="box2"> <p class="content">

"Please excuse me..."<br><br><br><br>
"I am not at all afraid of tigers," she went on, <br><br><br><br>"but I have a horror of drafts. <br><br><br><br>I
suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me?"<br><br><br><br>
"A horror of drafts−− that is bad luck, for a plant," <br><br><br><br>
